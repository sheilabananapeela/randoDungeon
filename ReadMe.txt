I use Visual Studio 19 and C++. Just click run for the release. It should print out this square by square text, 
where the 3 represent a room area, and the 1 represent some space and path. 

Was not sure if you wanted a maze or for them to connect, or if you wanted more things like actually drawing the walls.
